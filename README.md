# ArrayBasics

This program was just a program I had left over from my CS 121 when I was first
introduced to Arrays, and messing around with them a little bit, and learning how
to use them in print statements


# Caesar-Cipher

This program is designed to follow the basic Cryptography method called "Caesar Cipher. 
where to encrypt a message, you shift the original message by so and so characters."
Ex: HELLO shifted by 3 would become KHOOR. As the values simply follow the alphabet by
3 values.
Decrypting by inputting a negative value. 
Ex: KHOOR shifted by -3 would become HELLO.
